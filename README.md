# surfs_up
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide information about temperature trends before opening a surf shop. With the temperature data for June and December described we can tell if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
## Results
The following tables describes June's temperature statistics over time.

The following table describes December's temperature statistics over time.

Three takeaways from the two analysis deliverables:
- The average temperatures are close with June being around 75 and December being around 71, with that being stated the average tempature can be assumed to stay like that year round.
- The minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the greatest variance, and reflects a much lower temperature level in December that may not be conducive to ice cream or surfing. However, with standard deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December) we would expect a little more variation in the december numbers.
- The maximum temperatures are also close with 85 (June) and 83 (December) which is optimal weather for ice cream and surfing year round.
## Summary
Overall the weather in December and June are very similar, although December has a wider range of results, with its high being close to June's but its low well below June's.

Additional queries that could be run include: Precipation difference between June and December to determine is one has more rainy weather, as well as a comaparison by weather station, as we may see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. We would be primarily interested in the weather station closest to our prospective location, which would narrow the results and provide the best data for us to consider.
